# RF-MEMS-AND-Solid-State-Switches
## RF switching can be accomplished using a number of different technologies. 
### There are two main types of RF switches that compete with RF MEMS switches:  electro-mechanical RF switches and solid-state RF switches. 
### Solid state switches use semiconductor technologies to operate, such as silicon or PIN diodes, FETs (field-effect transistors), and hybrid technologies (which incorporate PINS ### and FETs) and are built using silicon-based substrates. RF MEMS switches compete with ever improving RF-SOI (Silicon on Insulator) based switches, which are the dominant   solution in the market today.
